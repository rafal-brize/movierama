    The empire strikes back
  description:
    Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hmm?  Hmm. And
    well you should not. For my ally is the Force, and a powerful ally it is.
    Life creates it, makes it grow. Its energy surrounds us and binds us.
    Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter. You must feel the Force
    around you; here, between you, me, the tree, the rock, everywhere, yes. Even
    between the land and the ship.

    Curiously, the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of
    petunias, as it fell, was, "Oh no, not again!" Many people have speculated
    that if we knew exactly *why* the bowl of petunias had thought that we would
    know a lot more about the nature of the universe than we do now.

    Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents'
    first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get
    married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's
    disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you
    repair the damage, you'll be next.

    I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in those last moments he loved life
    more than he ever had before. Not just his life - anybody's life; my life.
    All he'd wanted were the same answers the rest of us want. Where did I come
    from? Where am I going? How long have I got? All I could do was sit there
    and watch him die.
